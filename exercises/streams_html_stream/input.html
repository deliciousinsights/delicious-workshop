      <p>Wowbagger The Infinitely Prolonged was<em class="a bit loud">—indeed, is—</em>one of the Universe's very small number of immortal beings.</p>

      <p>Most of those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed, he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards. He had his immortality inadvertantly thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch, and a pair of rubber bands. The precise details are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying.</p>

      <p>…</p>

      <p>This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing that would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on forever. It was this:</p>

      <p class="loud">He would insult the Universe.</p>

      <p>That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in <strong class="pretty loud">Alphabetical Order</strong>.</p>

      <p>When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, <em class="quite loud">“A man can dream, can't he?”</em></p>
